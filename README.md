#### Languages & Libraries
In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. This is the way you take out your flustrations.

The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush.

We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world.

We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Just beat the devil out of it. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. Here we're limited by the time we have. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it.

Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend.

Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted.

We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Don't be bashful drop me a line. That's crazy. Let your heart be your guide.
