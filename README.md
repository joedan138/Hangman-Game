#### Description

This is a simple version of hangman with a wild west feel. All of the words to guess are wild west themed. To start playing click "Let's Begin". Use your mouse to go through and guess the letters for the word or phrase below. You have 9 lives in each round. Guess all of the letters and you win. Miss 9 times and you die.

#### Challenges
This was my first game I created in my bootcamp. I focused on the UI more than the logic as the logic was mostly simply. I did not want the game to look like a 3rd grader wrote it haha. I feel happy with the layout. 

The harder part of the logic came from showing the letters. I didn't have a clue on how to do that at first. But after a good deal og Google, Stack Overflow, and just writing bad code for a few hours, I was able to get it down.

#### Issues
Currently there are 2 issues with the gameplay. 

1. When you click "Let's Begin" it does not automatically load a new game. Instead you must then click "New Game" to be able to start playing. 

2. Once you guess all the correct letters there is no sort of notification that you won. If you are looking for you ego to be fed, this is not the game for you. The game will, however, definitely let you know that you lost. An alert will pop up saying, "You have lost".

#### Desired Features

* I would like for modals to appear when you have either won or lost. Currently there is no notification for winning, and an alert for when you lose. 

* You are able to select a letter more than once. I don't like that feel. 

* I want to hide an easter egg somewhere in the boards. I would like for it to take you to YouTube and play a clip from an old Clint Eastwood Western
